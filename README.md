Blak & Bloo
-----------------------

This is the start of an HTML5 match-3 game, in the vein of Bejewelled or Chuzzle.
It's built on top of my barebones HTML5 game library, [TangleJS](https://github.com/buyog/TangleJS),
and started life as an entry in the [js13kGames](https://twitter.com/js13kGames) coding contest.

Done
-----

* basic loading / title / game states
* tile swapping (code only, no user actions yet)
* row/column shifting (code only)
* basic tile-matching code (matches are immediately cleared)


ToDos
-----

* user actions (mouse / keyboard)
* backfill cleared tiles with new ones
* tile animations
* scoring
* p1/p2 mechanics
* co-op / compete modes
* size optimizations (graphics, code minification, etc)
